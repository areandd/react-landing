As currently estimated there are 7.753 Billion humans. Last I checked I was only 1 of those humans. Just running the numbers I could sit back and allow the other 7.753 billion to bear the burden for our species. I could get fat and lazy; in the end some other man would take on what I hadn’t. That wouldn’t be so terrible for the species, I wouldn’t be letting my people down…
